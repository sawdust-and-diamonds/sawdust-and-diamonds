👋 Hi, this is a new GitHub profile solely for hosting a new portfolio of my software projects. This account is completely unconnected to my other online indentities — untainted by the emotional residue of internet dramas and overactive online debates (of which I am a part-time fan, and which I believe are healthy in moderate doses!). Only good things shall come from this account.

🐚 As you can see, my interests include — apart from coding and creating software — music by Joanna Newsom and mysterious sea creatures from far before the dawn of historical time...
